	<title>Freedom Toaster - want a slice?</title>
	<para>The Internet has been hailed as a <quote>great equaliser</quote> (Brynjolfsson and Smith
		2000) of developing and developed nations. There are however, <quote>great disparities in
			opportunity to access the Internet, the information and the educational/business
			opportunities tied to this</quote> (wikipedia.org, 07.10.05).</para>
	<para>Billions of people live with restrictive telecommunications environments that make it
		difficult and costly to access digital products such as free software and educational
		content. The Freedom Toaster project was started in 2004 by the Shuttleworth Foundation as a
		way to overcome these problems. </para>
	<para>Freedom Toasters are conveniently located, self-contained, computer-based, &apos;Bring
		'n Burn&apos; facilities. Like vending machines, preloaded to dispense confectionery,
		Freedom Toasters are preloaded to dispense free digital products.</para>
	<orderedlist>
		<para>Obtaining a product is as simple as 1, 2, 3:</para>
		<listitem>
			<para>Bring writable CD or DVD media to the Freedom Toaster.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Insert into the Freedom Toasters' CD/DVD drive.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Select the product to duplicate.</para>
		</listitem>
	</orderedlist>
	<para>Unlike the vending machine, where people pay to obtain perishable consumable products.
		Freedom Toasters dispense new information, communication technologies, software and content
		that act as a catalyst for increasing peopleâ€™s choice and are directly translatable into
		knowledge, leading to greater freedom.</para>
	<para>Whilst a chocolate bar is consumed by one person, Freedom Toaster wares carry no
		restrictions. In fact, people are encouraged to make further copies and to distribute them,
		enabling the whole community to benefit.</para>

		<title>Freedom Toasters in Society</title>
		<para>Freedom Toasters are suitable for use by any organisation in any venue, for any
			purpose. Businesses, educational institutions, government departments, libraries and
			NGOs can all accelerate their mandates.</para>
		<para>Creating a list describing the purposes for which Freedom Toasters can be put to use,
			would stretch even the most fervent of imaginations, topical examples include the
			distribution of:</para>
		<itemizedlist>

				nots</quote> of the world.</para>

		<para>The main screen is one of several that cycle when the Freedom Toaster is not in use.
			Each screen provides information answering the common questions people have during their

		<para>Objective information about each of the products is made available. Touching the
				<guibutton>Previous</guibutton> or the <guibutton>Next</guibutton> button, people
			can browse the information provided at their leisure to make informed choices about what
			they would like to duplicate. Helpful information such as the number of CD/DVDs required
			ensures that people are prepared before making a selection.</para>

		<para>When selections are made and burning commences, the Freedom Toaster provides feedback
			of the current progress for each of the CD/DVD devices loaded with writable media.</para>
		<para>The entire Freedom Toaster interaction is designed as a <quote>Touch and Go</quote>
			experience that results in instant gratification the moment the CD/DVD writer ejects a
			duplicated media.</para>
