  <title>Freedom Toaster Website Update</title>

    <para>Welcome to the Freedom Toaster Educational Resources page.</para>

    <para>When the Wright brothers first flew their mechanical flying machine
    on December 17th 1903, everyone still thought that flying was only for the
    birds. Now we don't even think twice about people getting in an aeroplane
    and flying halfway around the world. In just over a century of mechanised
    flight people have grown accustomed to having flight as one of the
    options regarding travel. This has revolutionised global travel and
    business shipment options.</para>

    <para>The Freedom Toaster concept may not be quite as radical as
    mechanical flying machines, but it's ability to bring digital information
    to places where there has been none (or where bandwidth is costly or of
    poor quality) can bring about many positive changes to people's lives,
    businesses bottom lines, and countries' economic and cultural well
    being.</para>

    <para>The Shuttleworth Foundation has produced specific documents and
    articles that will help educate people about the Freedom Toaster, both in
    t's concept and it's physical reality. Please feel free to browse through
    these resources and download any that you find useful for yourself or for
    the community that you are living or working in.</para>

      <title>Brochure</title>

      <para>The Freedom Toaster Project has prepared a brochure that can be
      used by anyone in the community. If you are hosting a Freedom Toaster
      this brochure is useful to have for those people who have never seen a
      Freedom Toaster before and want some more information about it.</para>

      <para>The brochure is also useful for general education purposes. Please
      feel free to download the PDF and print copies for your local school,
      library, university, community centre.</para>

      <title>Hosting Experiences</title>

      <para>Did you ever wonder what the impact of the Freedom Toaster would
      be on your community? Have you thought of what benefits you would
      receive if you hosted a Freedom Toaster? Whenever a new concept or
      innovation becomes available there is generally a lag between the time
      that becomes available and general knowledge of it's availability. The
      Freedom Toaster has been available in concept form for well over a year,
      and as a physical machine in certain locations for almost as long. The
      time lag between availability and community knowledge of that
      availability is now closing, and it is time that more and more
      communities got involved.</para>

      <para>The Freedom Toaster Project has the potential to change the way
      electronic information is distributed. If you have used one then you
      already know the great benefit of being able to go to a Freedom Toaster
      and toast a Linux Distribution or the OpenOffice.org setup disk. If you
      are already hosting a Freedom Toaster at your community centre, library,
      computer shop, internet café, coffee bar, supermarket chain, etc. then
      you know the benefits to your own business and the benefits to your
      community.</para>

      <para>The following articles and stories are presentations of the
      Freedom Toaster being hosted by various characters in different
      situations around the world. Some of the articles are mental projections
      of what would happen if 'this type of person in a particular type of
      business in particular country were to host a Freedom Toaster'. Others
      are based on real situations and real businesses.</para>

      <para>If you have ever wondered where to put a Freedom Toaster, read
      these articles and find some possibilities for you to think
      about...</para>

      <title>Case Studies</title>

      <para>A case study is an intensive, detailed description and analysis of
      a single project or program in the context of it's environment. As such
      case studies are a valuable way to share the experiences of others who
      have travelled the road before you. They are also useful for encouraging
      discussion about best practises and problem-solving strategies.</para>

      <para>The Freedom Toaster has been hard at work in various locations in
      South Africa and Namibia. Daily people are toasting CDs and DVDs of the
      latest FOSS (Free and Open Source) software and other free license
      content for their own use and benefit. Business, educational
      institutions, libraries, and community projects are using the Freedom
      Toaster to better the lives of the people within their influence through
      hosting a Freedom Toaster.</para>

      <para>Take an opportunity to observe the Freedom Toaster in action by
      reading these Case Studies...</para>

      <title>White Papers</title>

      <para>The Freedom Toaster concept is one that can bring great benefit to
      many people around the world. If we think of the Freedom Toaster as a
      'bandwidth substitute', then wherever we find low Internet penetration
      and low bandwidth infrastructures we will also find a place that would
      benefit from the Freedom Toaster. These places could be low bandwidth
      areas due to economic reasons (i.e. poverty areas in the developed
      world)) or due to slow infrastructure development (i.e. lack of
      computers/dialup/dsl in developing countries), or a combination of
      both.</para>

      <para>It is not difficult to imagine many different scenarios in which
      the Freedom Toaster as it stand today, and the concepts upon which it is
      based on, will bring important solutions to communities and countries
      around the world (link to user cases). For this reason the Shuttleworth
      Foundation has prepared Freedom Toaster White Papers (An educational
      report made available to the public/specific decision making body that
      expounds on a particular issue. It is called white paper because it was
      originally bound in white) for presentation to three different
      audiences, the United Nations, Governmental Agencies, and Non
      Governmental Organisations.</para>

      <para>These White Papers are being made available to the public so that
      anyone may increase their own understanding of the Freedom Toaster
      Project, and may use the information presented in the White Papers to
      educate themselves and others. These White Papers may be downloaded and
      used as presentation material to organisations and communities that may
      be interested in the benefits that the Freedom Toaster Project will
      bring.</para>
