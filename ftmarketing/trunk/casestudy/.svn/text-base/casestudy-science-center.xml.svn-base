	<title>The Case of the MTN ScienCenter Freedom Toaster</title>
	<sect1>
		<title>Introduction</title>
		<para>South Africa, 2005. A developing nation struggling to shake off its part-apartheid
			shackles stands at a technological watershed. With a burgeoning population of 46.9 million<footnote>
				<para>StatsSA - Key findings: P0302 - population estimates</para>
			</footnote>, and an unemployment rate of 26.2 percent<footnote>
				<para>StatsSA - Labour force survey - 2004</para>
			</footnote>, South Africans are technologically divided. Those with access to technology
			are more readily able to secure high-income positions, while the technologically
			illiterate are increasingly sidelined. It’s a classic case of the rich getting richer,
			with the poor getting poorer.</para>
		<para>The South African government has made known how high an importance it places on income
			inequality and the equitable distribution of wealth. Studies have indicated that South
			Africa has a Gini coefficient for per capita income at around 0.7. When plotted on a
			Lorenz curve, this tells us that 80% of South Africa’s wealth is controlled by 27% of
			the population. </para>
		<para>When it comes to bridging the technological divide, several government programs are in
			place to promote the accessibility of computers in rural and developing areas, but there
			is still a great need for increased technology penetration. While complete technological
			integration on a real level into every South African community may only be a dream,
			promoting technological literacy on a grass-roots level is a vital component of
			empowerment.</para>
		<para>Ultimately, technology is expensive. Internet access under Telkom’s monopoly is
			restrictive due to the high prices, software licenses are costly, computers often cost
			more than an entire household's earnings and in some places even reliable access to
			electricity cannot be secured.</para>
		<para>Despite the obstacles there exists a huge demand for technological access and
			literacy, particularly among the emerging middle-class composed primarily of the
			historically disadvantaged. With technological competency fast becoming a prerequisite
			for any sort of skilled labour, making technology cheaply and widely available is a
			social and economic priority.</para>
		<para>While the chief problem associated with computer literacy will always be cost, a
			substantial portion of the expenditure incurred can be negated by switching to Free and
			Open Source Software (FOSS). However, open source software has its own drawbacks,
			particularly in the unique South African context. Without a reliable, fast internet
			connection, many open source applications and operating systems are all but
			inaccessible.</para>

		<title>Overview</title>
		<para>FOSS is a viable alternative to licensing proprietary software, but has several key
			drawbacks within the South African context.</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>The local market is dominated by traditional thinking when it comes to
					software usage, and as such, expensive, proprietary, closed source software is
					preferred.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Complete distributions of open source software, particularly operating
					systems, are often large and unwieldy, making them difficult to download through
					antiquated modem and ISDN technology.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Reliable, cheap internet in South Africa is all but non-existent; only a tiny
					percentage of the population can download FOSS.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Open source software is perceived as being difficult to use, with a
					substantial learning curve.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<title>Analysis of the Freedom Toaster</title>
		<para>The Freedom Toaster was created to address the shortcomings of the open source model
			in the South African context. While FOSS is hugely popular in much of the world, its
			growth in South Africa has been stunted by the backward state of the South African
			telecommunications industry.</para>
		<para>FOSS relies heavily on the internet. Not only is the internet the primary means of
			distributing FOSS, but it serves - through forums, message boards and email discussion -
			as an arena for FOSS users to contribute back into the community. In an environment such
			as South Africa, with its limited and expensive internet access it hardly seems
			surprising that the uptake of FOSS is lagging behind other developing countries. </para>
		<para>In order to fully understand the need the Freedom Toaster fulfils in South Africa, a
			short overview of the South African internet situation needs to be presented. The South
			African telecommunications market is for all intents and purposes, a monopoly. The only
			fixed line provided is the former state-owned Telkom. Although Telkom has recently gone
			public, a significant portion of the company is still government owned, and as such, is
			plagued by many of the negative traits associated with a government-run enterprise such
			poor customer service, an ineffective administrative bureaucracy and a reluctance to
			move away from obsolete technology and procedures.</para>
		<para>As the only fixed line operator, Telkom has a virtual stranglehold on the South
			African internet community. Telkom recently launched its digital subscriber line (DSL)
			offering, a move that was hoped would foster the spread of FOSS locally, but
			unfortunately, this has not been the case.</para>
		<para>The problem lies with Telkom’s pricing of its DSL offering and its bandwidth usage
			structure. Firstly, although DSL may be synonymous with speed in the rest of the world,
			Telkom’s fastest DSL offering is a paltry 1024 kilobit line, giving an effective
			download speed of around 100 kilobytes per second, a far cry from residential cable and
			DSL packages in the United States and Europe, which are up to 100 times faster.</para>
		<para>Apart from the relatively low speeds, in order to discourage what Telkom terms ‘abuse’
			of the DSL network, subscribers are restricted to how much network traffic they can
			accumulate in a month. Once a user exceeds his or her bandwidth limit for the month,
			they are ‘capped’, and their service is effectively suspended. Additional bandwidth can
			be purchased from Telkom, which in effect serves as the sole wholesaler of DSL
			bandwidth, but it is prohibitively expensive to do so.</para>
		<para>For example, the latest version of the Debian operating system consists of two DVD
			images totalling 8.48 gigabytes, a hefty sum of data. Using Telkom’s 1024 HomeDSL
			package (the fastest available) and Telkom Internet’s Premium ISP offering would incur
			the following costs:</para>
		<informalequation>
			<mediaobject>
				<textobject>
					<para>R680.00 monthly rental fee + three Advanced Shaped TelkomInternet surfing
						packages @ R269.00 = R1487.</para>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>
		</informalequation>
		<para>By comparison, Bulldog Broadband, a broadband provider in the UK charges £40.00 per
			month for uncapped DSL, so there’s no need with such a service provider to purchase
			additional bandwidth at all. At current exchange rates, £40.00 equates to R470.40. Such
			a comparison is not entirely accurate though – Bulldog Broadband subscribers not only
			enjoy unlimited bandwidth, but other benefits as well, such as a free DSL router,
			something Telkom sells to its subscribers for R799.00.</para>
		<para>It’s also worth mentioning that the Bulldog Broadband service mentioned above is eight
			times faster than Telkom’s fastest DSL offering, so the 8.48gb Debian download that
			would take you an entire day on Telkom’s DSL would be done within three hours on Bulldog
			Broadband.</para>
		<para>While broadband has catalysed the FOSS movement in Europe, the United States and much
			of the rest of the world, Telkom’s poor DSL offering has served to effectively choke the
			uptake of both FOSS and the open source mentality in South Africa. </para>
		<para>Enter the Freedom Toaster, the apparent solution to many of South Africa’s open source
			distribution woes. The Freedom Toaster is essentially a FOSS vending machine; users
			bring their own blank CD or DVD discs and select software to 'toast' to the disc. The
			process is expedited by a user-friendly touch-screen interface that ensures even novice
			users can select and burn the software they require.</para>
		<para>The Freedom Toaster's selection of software is not limited to Linux distributions.
			Software such as the OpenCD and OpenOffice.org is available as well. The OpenCD contains
			a wealth of free Windows software such as Firefox and Thunderbird, which serve as free
			alternatives to Internet Explorer and Outlook. The selection of Windows-compatible
			software on the Freedom Toaster makes it an invaluable tool for those who have opted to
			stay with Microsoft Windows, but who require low-cost, functional desktop utilities and
			applications.</para>

		<title>Implimentation</title>
		<para>By placing Freedom Toasters in strategic locations, the Shuttleworth Foundation has
			attempted to maximise the effectiveness of the Freedom Toaster concept. One such Toaster
			is located at the MTN ScienCenter at Canal Walk shopping centre, Cape Town.</para>
		<para>The MTN ScienCentre at Canal Walk is South Africa's first world-class interactive
			science centre. Designed to stimulate an interest in science and technology among South
			African youth, the MTN ScienCentre aims to be trendy and hip to attract increasingly
			mobile and technologically savvy youth. Exhibitions and presentations are topical,
			interesting and thought-provoking.</para>
		<para>The MTN ScienCenter was chosen as a Freedom Toaster location for several reasons:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>It's centrally located in one of the largest malls in Southern Africa</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>It has strong connotations with innovation and technological progress</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Its appeal to technologically-minded youth</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Its favourable location within Canal Walk itself </para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>These factors have combined to create a Freedom Toaster that has had an undeniable
			impact on the local community. Located within close proximity to the Canal Walk cinema,
			a substantial portion of the Freedom Toaster's users have been young adults and
			teenagers in need of open source distributions. In six months in 2004, the MTN
			ScienCenter Toaster was used to burn a total of 1335 distributions<footnote>
				<para>
					<ulink url="http://www.freedomtoaster.org/?q=node/12">FreedomToaster.org</ulink>
				</para>
			</footnote>.</para>
		<para>With its unique placement and substantial foot traffic, the MTN ScienCenter is
			uniquely positioned to serve a younger, more mobile demographic. With shopping malls
			increasingly becoming a place of recreation for upwardly mobile youth, this Freedom
			Toaster is ideally suited to promote the uptake of open source software among younger
			users.</para>
		<para>Younger computer users tend to have significantly less disposable income than older
			demographics, but what they lack in finance they typically make up for in enthusiasm and
			a willingness to learn. While older users may be reluctant to switch to an open source
			operating system due to the learning curve, such a challenge is often embraced by
			younger users.</para>
		<para>For much the same reason, Linux and other open source programs are gaining a
			widespread following among the youth, who view it not only as potentially vital skill in
			the corporate world, but a comparatively uncharted area with massive potential for
			future reward. With an oversupply of technical qualifications for proprietary systems
			such as the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE), many potential IT students are
			becoming increasingly aware that career options in the field of Linux and UNIX
			administration may prove more lucrative and secure. Freedom Toasters such as the one at
			the MTN ScienCenter are in a position to take advantage of this line of thinking by
			providing a convenient, cheap and reliable means to obtain the software necessary to
			work within and learn about the open source community.</para>
		<para>Branded as a hip and trendy portal into the world of open source, and positioned in a
			high-impact area frequented by teenagers and pre-adolescents, a Freedom Toaster such as
			the one located at the MTN ScienCenter is an invaluable tool in promoting not only open
			source awareness, but job creation. Anyone wishing to dabble in open source now needs
			only take a trip to their nearest Freedom Toaster in order to do so. </para>
		<para>Although no reliable figures can be given so soon after its inception, it only takes
			one distribution in the right hands to create a lifelong love of open source, one copy
			of OpenOffice.org to provide an entire school with a desktop publishing application, one
			CD with Firefox and Thunderbird to enable a household to finally connect to the
			internet.</para>
