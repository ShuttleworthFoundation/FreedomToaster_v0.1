- find a way to get rid of focus border on buttons
- try to give the window a background
- remove 'insert disk and', instead add a check + a new window asking for disk
- make obvious that buttons are clickable (maybe background colour/picture)
-freedos?
- move mouse pointer to a corner after an operation starts/ends so it doesn't hightlight a button
- timers to close windows
- logs
