   <name>Gentoo</name>
   <description>Our very definite personal favourite</description>
   <advantages>
      <advantage>Gentoo uses a system of "emerge" to install and upgrade packages. This means your system is always bleeding edge</advantage>
      <advantage>As a result, Gentoo is VERY on your hardware - it's compiled for it!</advantage>
      <advantage>It is gaining a loyal following</advantage>
   </advantages>
   <disadvantages>
      <disadvantage>To really get the most out of Gentoo, you should be connected to the Internet</disadvantage>
      <disadvantage>Some people new to Linux find it hard to install and configure Gentoo</disadvantage>
      <disadvantage>It chooses state-of-the-art over stability.</disadvantage>
