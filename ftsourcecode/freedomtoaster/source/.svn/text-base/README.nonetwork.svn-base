INSTALLING A NETWORK-FREE FREEDOM TOASTER
=========================================

1) Boot Ubuntu Breezy Install CD
2) Type 'server' <ENTER>
3) Answer questions until partitioning screen
4) Choose 'Partition disks Manually'
5) Use the following partition scheme (or similar):
   boot 64 MB
	/     2 GB
	home  2 GB
	var   2 GB
	tmp   2 GB reiserfs
	swap  2 GB swap
	usr   3 GB
	srv   the rest (I have used 66 GB)

6) Create user with name 'kiosk-admin', login kiosk-admin, and a password
7) When prompted, take out the Breezy Install disk and let the system reboot
8) At login prompt, login as kiosk-admin with your password
9) sudo su  (and enter your kiosk-admin password)

10) Mount the 'Freedom Toaster V3.0 Install' CD:
    #mount /media/cdrom0
11) #cd /media/cdrom0
12) #. ./SetupScript
13) Choose 'y'
    SELECT INSTALLATION SOURCE = 1
	 CD OR REPOSITORY = 1 (CD)

14) The system will copy everything to a tmp directory, and will
    start again from step (13).  Answer the questions in the same
	 way: y 1 1
15) You will be prompted for a disc - just press <ENTER> because it
    is apt-cdrom asking for the 'Freedom Toaster V3.0 Install CD'
16) Apt-cdrom will prompt you for a name for this disk, use 'FT3.0'

17) After all the automatic upgrading etc, X will prompt you for resolutions etc.
    Choose 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768
18) You will be prompted for a short unique name for this toaster - I use freedom 1 and freedom6,
    so use something else
19) At the prompt for the administrator password, you MUST use only 0-9 and a-z, no capitals, no spaces
    no funnies because those are the only keys available to you on the password entry screen keyboard
20) At the prompt for the egalax touchscreen drivers choose Y if you have one.
21) Do the 4-point calibration on the X screen when it comes up.
22) Close the egalax calibration window, and log in to the admin section of the freedom toaster by
    clicking the 'home' button (top left) and on the home page clicking the space where the home
	 button was.
23) At the administrator login password screen, type in the password you set in step (19).
24) Click on the 'Calibrate Drives' button on top right of the admin screen and go through the steps to
    set the order of the drives and mark their capabilities.
25) A reboot puts the machine in kiosk mode.
