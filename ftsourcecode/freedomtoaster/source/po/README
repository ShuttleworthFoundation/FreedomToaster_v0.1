             The Freedom Toaster translation toolchain
              ==========================
              
When strings change somewhere in the source code of the Freedom Toaster
software, the Makefile in the po folder provide commands for updating the
templates for translation. The entire toolchain is described here:

1) A string changes in a source file (HTMl, Perl, etc.)
2) "make pot" creates a new .pot (template) file
3) The new pot file should then be uploaded to Rosetta
    https://launchpad.net/products/ftsoftware/+translations
4) When translators have translated the new/modified strings, the po files 
    are downloaded from Rosetta and commited in SVN
5) If a new language (.po file) is downloaded, the LINGUAS file has to be
    updated with the new language code, as well as the kiosk/languages.txt
    file
6) "make translations" regenerates the localised HTML files for each 
    language, as well as the .mo compiled file

About images
========
When an image needs to be localized, create a .png file without the English
text, and save it in the image-factory folder. Import the png in Inkscape and
add the English text in a text block here. Save the resulting file in a .svg file
in image-factory.
As svg files are XML, this allows for extracting all strings to be put in a .po
translation file.

At build time ('make translations'), it replaces the original text with the 
localized one and export the result in a .png localized image in the 
/locale/../image dir.
